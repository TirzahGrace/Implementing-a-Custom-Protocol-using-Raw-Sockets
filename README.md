# simDNS Protocol Implementation

## Description:
This project implements a simplified DNS (Domain Name System) protocol, called simDNS, using raw sockets in C. The simDNS protocol allows a client to send a query for the IP address corresponding to a domain name, and the server responds with the IP address.

## Instructions:

### 1. Running the server:
To run the server, use the following command:
```bash
cd CODE/
make server
```
Make sure to run the server before the client.

### 3. Running the client:
To run client, use the following command in a different terminal:
```bash
cd CODE/
make client
```

## Note:
- Run the server and Client in seperate Terminals.
- Ensure that the server is running before you run the client.
